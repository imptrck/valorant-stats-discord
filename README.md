# Valorant Statistics
Have yours and your clan statistics in Discord


# Description

Still a fresh idea in mind. This is a small scope idea to use Discord and the unnofficial Valorant API (https://github.com/Henrik-3/unofficial-valorant-api) as a point to show and connect data.

# Usage Tutorial


### View Stats
`!valorapi stats`
This should print a list of users registered and their respective current ranks.

### Add User
`!valorapi user Brusse#HJM`
This should add a user to the server list, this will be tracked whenever using *View Stats* command.


# Developers
Nothing yet, once we have code and need to document something how to build your own instance/modify, we'll do so. 


# Work in progress
This is a study repository that intend, for those involved, learn python, how to build discord bots and consume a REST API. It should be empty in the beginning and as we deal with the MVP, which are the current two commands idea, we plan to add more resources like snapshot, progress, and more. ~You know, if you want KDA and per match statistics, you have things like Tracker.GG :-)~

Hopefully, this will be well documented and done as the maintainers have time to do it. Feel free to raise issues/PRs if needed.
